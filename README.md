# Google Scholar Article Search and Filter

## Description

This project provides a tool that automates the search for academic articles on Google Scholar using the SerpApi and filters results based on specific keywords and topics. The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`, allowing users to input their API key, define search queries, and specify filtering criteria. Results are saved to Excel files and can be further filtered by examining the content of linked web pages.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **openpyxl:** Working with Excel files.
- **requests:** Making HTTP requests to extract web page content.
- **BeautifulSoup:** Parsing HTML content to extract text and search for keywords.
- **serpapi:** API for accessing Google Scholar search results.
- **tkinter:** Creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
