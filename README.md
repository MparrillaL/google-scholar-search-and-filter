# Google Scholar Article Search and Filter

This project provides a tool that automates the search for academic articles on Google Scholar using the SerpApi and filters results based on specific keywords and topics. The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`, allowing users to input their API key, define search queries, and specify filtering criteria. Results are saved to Excel files and can be further filtered by examining the content of linked web pages.
